    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        To Make the Dough in a Stand Mixer: Combine flour, yeast, and salt in
        the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Stir to
        combine, then add water. Mix on low speed until dough comes together
        into a rough ball, then shut off mixer and let rest for 10 minutes.
        Continue mixing at medium-low speed until dough forms a smooth, silky
        ball, about 10 minutes longer. (It should stick to the bottom of the
        bowl as it kneads rather than riding around the edges.) Remove dough
        hook, form dough into a tight ball, set in the bottom of the mixer bowl,
        cover tightly with plastic wrap, and set aside in a warm place until
        dough has roughly doubled in volume, about 2 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        To Make the Dough in a Food Processor: Combine flour, yeast, and salt in
        the bowl of a food processor and pulse to combine. Add water, then turn
        on processor and process until dough forms a ball that rides around the
        bowl of the processor, about 30 seconds. Continue processing for 30
        seconds longer. Transfer dough to a bowl, form a tight ball, cover
        tightly with plastic wrap, and set aside in a warm place until dough has
        roughly doubled in volume, about 2 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        To Make the Dough by Hand: Combine flour, yeast, and salt in a large
        bowl. Whisk to combine, then add water and stir with a wooden spoon
        until a rough ball of dough has formed. Set aside for 10 minutes. Turn
        dough out onto a countertop and knead until a smooth, silky ball has
        formed, about 10 minutes. Transfer dough to a bowl, form a tight ball,
        cover tightly with plastic wrap, and set aside in a warm place until
        dough has roughly doubled in volume, about 2 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour a couple tablespoons olive oil in the bottom of a Detroit-style
        anodized aluminum pan or two 8- by 8-inch cake pans. (Split dough in
        half if using cake pans.) Transfer dough to pan(s) and turn to coat in
        oil. Press down on dough and spread it toward the edges. You won't be
        able to get it all the way to the edges; this is okay. Spread it as much
        as you can without tearing, then cover tightly in plastic and set aside
        for 30 minutes to allow dough to relax. Return to dough and stretch it
        out again. It should be able to reach the edges this time. If not, let
        it rest a little more and try again. To get the dough to stay in the
        corners, stretch it up beyond the corners so that it pulls back into
        place. Once dough is stretched, cover again and set aside while you make
        the sauce.
      </li>

        For the Sauce: Adjust oven rack to lowest position and preheat oven to
        550°F (290°C), or as close to it as your oven gets. Heat 2 tablespoons
        (30ml) olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat until shimmering.
        Add minced garlic, oregano, and pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until
        fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add tomatoes, garlic powder, onion powder,
        and sugar. Bring to a simmer and cook until reduced to about 3 cups,
        about 30 minutes. Season to taste with salt.
      </li>

        To Form the Pizza: Press down on dough with your fingertips to remove
        any large air bubbles. Lay half of pepperoni (if using) evenly over face
        of dough. Top with cheese, spreading it evenly all the way to the very
        edges of the pan, then add remaining pepperoni. Spoon sauce over surface
        in 3 even rows. (You will need only about half the sauce—save the rest
        for another pizza.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer to oven and bake until edges are black and bubbly and exposed
        cheese on top is starting to lightly brown, 12 to 15 minutes. (If your
        oven doesn't cook well from the bottom, consider placing the pizza
        directly on the oven floor.) Transfer to a trivet or folded kitchen
        towel on countertop.
      </li>
      <li>
        Run a thin metal spatula all the way around the edges of the pan to
        loosen the pizza. Carefully lift it out and slide it onto a cutting
        board. Cut pizza and serve.
