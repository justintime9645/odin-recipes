    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Delicious pasta with perfectly cooked chicken and broccoli.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts cut into 1-inch cubes salt
        and ground black pepper to season the chicken
      </li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 medium onion, minced (about 1 cup)</li>
      <li>medium cloves garlic, minced or finely chopped</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>8 ounces ziti (2 cups)</li>
      <li>2 & 3/4 cups water</li>
      <li>1 & 2/3 cups low-sodium chicken broth</li>
      <li>12 ounces broccoli florets (about 3-4 cups)</li>
      <li>1/2 cup half & half (you can also use heavy cream)</li>
      <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese, plus extra for serving</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice (about 1/2 of a large lemon)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Season the chicken generously with salt and pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon of
        the olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until
        just smoking. Add the chicken in a single layer and cook for 1 minute
        without stirring. Stir the chicken and continue to cook until most, but
        not all, of the pink color has disappeared and the chicken is lightly
        browned around the edges, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Transfer the chicken to
        a clean bowl and set aside (this may seem odd that you're not cooking
        the chicken through completely, but trust me, it works!)
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the remaining tablespoon of oil, minced onion, and 1/2 teaspoon salt
        to the skillet. Return the skillet to medium-high heat and cook the
        onion, stirring often, until the onion is softened, 2 to 5 minutes. Stir
        in the garlic, oregano, and pepper flakes, and cook until fragrant,
        about 30 seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the ziti, 2 cups of the water, and the chicken broth. Bring to a
        boil over high heat and cook until the liquid is very thick and syrupy
        and almost completely absorbed, 12 to 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the broccoli and the remaining 3/4 cup water. Cover, reduce the heat
        to medium, and cook until the broccoli turns bright green and is almost
        tender, 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Uncover and return the heat to high. Stir in the half and half, parmesan
        cheese, and reserved chicken with any accumulated juices and continue to
        simmer, uncovered, until the sauce is thickened and the chicken is
        cooked and heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the ziti from the heat
        and stir in the lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
        Garnish with more parmesan cheese if desired.
